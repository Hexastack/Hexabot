## Description

[Hexabot](https://hexabot.ai/) is an open-source AI chatbot / agent solution. It  allows you to create and manage multi-channel, and multilingual chatbots / agents with ease. Hexabot is designed for flexibility and customization, offering powerful text-to-action capabilities. Originally a closed-source project (version 1), we've now open-sourced version 2 to contribute to the community and enable developers to customize and extend the platform with extensions.

**NOTE:** We are currently working to package it in a way that it would be easy to install and use, hence there's no version release just yet.

## Directory Structure

- **frontend:** The admin panel built with React/Next.js for managing chatbot configurations and flows.
- **api:** The backend API built with NestJS and connected to MongoDB for data storage and management.
- **widget:** A React-based live chat widget that can be embedded into any website to provide real-time interaction.
- **nlu:** The NLU Engine built with Python, enabling intent recognition and language detection through machine learning models.
- **docker:** A set of Docker Compose files for deploying the entire solution, making it easy to run Hexabot in any environment.

## Prerequisites

To ensure Hexabot runs smoothly, you'll need the following:

- **Docker:** We recommend using Docker to start the app since multiple services are required (MongoDB, Redis, Prometheus, etc.). All the necessary Docker Compose files are located in the docker folder.
- **Node.js:** For development purposes, ensure you have Node.js >= v18.17.0 installed. We recommend using nvm (Node Version Manager) to easily manage and update your Node.js versions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hexastack/hexabot.git
```

2. **Installation:**
Install node dependencies:
```bash
$ npm install
```

3. **Environment Setup:** To configure the environment variables, use the following command at the root folder for initialization:

```bash
$ npx hexabot init
```

This will copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` in the `./docker` directory if the file does not already exist.

4. **Running the Application:** Once your environment is set up, you can start the app. Use either of the following commands:

```bash
$ npx hexabot start
```

or for development mode:

```bash
$ npx hexabot dev
```

You can also enable services such as the NLU engine or Nginx :

```bash
$ npx hexabot --enable=nlu
```

**Note:** The first time you run the app, Docker will take some time to download all the required images.

## Usage

UI Admin Panel is accessible via http://localhost:8080, the default credentials are :

- **Username:** admin@admin.admin
- **Password:** adminadmin

Live Chat Widget is accessible via http://localhost:5173

## Commands

- `npx hexabot init` : Copies the .env.example file to .env in the ./docker directory if .env does not exist. This is usually used for initial setup.
- `npx hexabot dev` : Starts all configured Docker services in development mode. It first checks the .env file for completeness against .env.example and builds the docker images locally.
- `npx hexabot start` : Starts all configured Docker services by loading all images from Docker Hub. This target also checks the .env file for required variables.
- `npx hexabot stop` : Stops all running Docker services defined in the compose files.
- `npx hexabot destroy` : Stops all services and removes all volumes associated with the Docker compose setup, ensuring a clean state.

Example on how to start the stack by adding the Nginx service :

```sh
npx hexabot start --enable=nginx
```
