## Workspace Tooling

This repository is managed with a PNPM workspace and Turborepo for task orchestration.

```bash
pnpm install          # install all workspace dependencies
pnpm dev              # run package dev servers in parallel
pnpm build            # build all packages
pnpm lint             # lint across the workspace
pnpm test             # execute test suites
pnpm --filter @hexabot/api run dev        # run a package script
```

PNPM is bundled with Node.js via Corepack. Enable it with `corepack enable pnpm@9.12.0` if necessary.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20.18.1
- pnpm (via Corepack)
- Docker installed

### Installation

Install Hexabot CLI globally to have easy access to its commands:

```sh
npm install -g hexabot-cli
```

### Usage

1. **Create a new project**:

   ```sh
   hexabot create my-chatbot
   ```

   This will create a new folder `my-chatbot` with all necessary files to get started.

2. **Navigate to your project folder**:

   ```sh
   cd my-chatbot
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

4. **Initialize environment**:

   ```sh
   hexabot init
   ```

   This command copies the `.env.example` file to `.env`, which you can edit to customize your configuration.

5. **Run in development mode**:

   ```sh
   hexabot dev --services ollama
   ```

   This starts the required services in development mode.

```

```

3. **Environment Setup:** To configure the environment variables, use the following command at the root folder for initialization:

```

This will copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` in the `./docker` directory if the file does not already exist.

4. **Running the Application:** Once your environment is set up, you can start the app. Use either of the following commands:


For development mode:

```bash
$ hexabot dev
```

Otherwise, you can choose to download docker images rather than building them:

```

You can also enable services such as Ollama (The services are declared under the `./docker` folder) :

```bash
$ hexabot dev --services ollama
```

**Note:** The first time you run the app, Docker will take some time to download all the required images.
