# Hexabot Live Chat Widget
The [Hexabot](https://hexabot.ai/) Live Chat Widget is a React-based embeddable widget that allows users to integrate real-time chat functionality into their websites. It connects to the Hexabot API and facilitates seamless interaction between end-users and chatbots across multiple channels.

[Hexabot](https://hexabot.ai/) is an open-source chatbot / agent solution that allows users to create and manage AI-powered, multi-channel, and multilingual chatbots with ease. If you would like to learn more, please visit the [official github repo](https://github.com/Hexastack/Hexabot/).

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Chat:** Engage in real-time conversations with users directly through your website.

- **Multi-Channel Support:** Integrates with multiple messaging platforms through the Hexabot API.
- **Embeddable:** Simple to embed and integrate into any web page with just a few lines of code.

## Directory Structure
The Hexabot Live Chat Widget is organized into the following directory structure, under `src` we have:

- **src/assets:** Static assets like icons, fonts, and images used in the widget.
- **src/components:** Reusable React components that make up the chat widget interface, such as message bubbles, input fields, and buttons.
- **src/constants:** Hard coded values that are used like colors.
- **src/hooks:** Custom React hooks for managing widget state and handling side effects like API calls or real-time events.
- **src/services:** Handles external services, such as communication with the Hexabot API or other third-party integrations.
- **src/styles:** Contains the styling for the widget, including CSS or SCSS files used to define the look and feel of the chat interface.
- **src/providers:** Context providers for managing global state, such as user session, chat messages, and widget configurations.
- **src/translations:** Contains transalation of a couple of strings.
- **src/types:** Defines the typescript interfaces, types, and enums used.
- **src/utils:** Utility functions and helpers used throughout the widget, such as formatting, validations, or data transformations.


- **/public:** Contains static files that are publicly accessible. This includes the main HTML template where the widget is embedded for local development.

## Run the Live Chat Widget

### Dev Mode
To run the widget in development mode, execute the following command at the project root level:
```bash
npm run dev:widget
```

The live chat widget will be accessible at http://localhost:5173.


### Build for Production
To build the widget for production, execute the following command at the widget folder level:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will generate a production-ready build in the dist folder.

## Embed Chat Widget
Once the widget is built, you can easily embed it into any webpage. Here's an example of how to add it to your website:


```js
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">
<script src="<<WIDGET URL>>/hexabot-widget.umd.js"></script>

<div id="hb-chat-widget"></div>
<script>
  const el = React.createElement;
  const domContainer = document.getElementById('hb-chat-widget');
  ReactDOM.render(
    el(HexabotWidget, {
      apiUrl: 'https://api.yourdomain.com',
      channel: 'web-channel',
      token: 'token123',
    }),
    domContainer,
  );
</script>
```
Replace the values in apiUrl and token with your configuration details.

To prevent the website css from conflicting with the chat widget css, we can leverage the shadow dom: 
```js
<script crossorigin src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="<<WIDGET URL>>/hexabot-widget.umd.js"></script>

<div id="hb-chat-widget"></div>
<script>
  // Create the shadow root and attach it to the widget container
  const createElement = (tag, props = {}) => Object.assign(document.createElement(tag), props);
  const shadowContainer = createElement("div");
  document
      .getElementById('hb-chat-widget')
      .attachShadow({ mode: 'open' })
      .append( 
        shadowContainer,
        createElement("link", {
          rel: "stylesheet",
          href: "<<WIDGET URL>>/style.css"
        });
      );

  // Render the widget inside the shadow root
  ReactDOM.render(
    React.createElement(HexabotWidget, {
      apiUrl: 'https://api.yourdomain.com',
      channel: 'web-channel',
      token: 'token123',
    }),
    shadowContainer,
  );
</script>
```
