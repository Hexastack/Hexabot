# Google Gemini Flow Plugin for Hexabot Chatbot Builder

The Gemini Flow Plugin allows you to integrate Google Generative AI into your Hexabot chatbot workflows, enabling the creation of generative AI Flow. This plugin provides settings for customizing responses, including controlling the maximum length of the generated content and using recent conversation messages as context for generating more relevant replies.

[Hexabot](https://hexabot.ai/) is an open-source chatbot / agent solution that allows users to create and manage AI-powered, multi-channel, and multilingual chatbots with ease. If you would like to learn more, please visit the [official github repo](https://github.com/Hexastack/Hexabot/).

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Gemini Flow Plugin, you will need to generate an API token from Google’s Generative AI platform.

1. Go to the [Google Generative AI API page](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api).
2. Select **"Develop in your own environment"** to generate your API token.
3. Once you have your API token, you can proceed to configure the plugin within Hexabot.

## Installation

First, navigate to your Hexabot project directory and make sure the dependencies are installed:

```sh
cd ~/projects/Hexabot
npm install
```

## Configuration

The Gemini Flow Plugin provides several customizable settings that can be configured through the Hexabot admin interface. The following settings are available:

- **Token**: Your Google API token for authentication. This is a required field.
- **Model**: The model to be used for generating responses (e.g., `gemini-1.5-flash`).
- **Temperature**: Controls the creativity of the response. Higher values lead to more creative outputs.
- **Max Length**: Specifies the maximum length of the response generated by the AI.
- **Messages to Retrieve**: The number of recent messages to include as context when sending a request to the AI.
- **Context**: A description or context about the chatbot that is passed along with each request to the API.
- **Instructions**: Custom instructions for how the AI should handle each request, based on your use case.

## How to Use

1. Go to the Hexabot Visual Editor.
2. Drag-n-drop the Google Gemini under "Custom Blocks" into the canvas.
3. Double-click on the block to edit

## Example

Here’s an example of a typical prompt that the plugin generates when sending a request to the API:

```
CONTEXT: You are an AI Chatbot that works for Hexastack, This is their description: ...

DOCUMENTS:
  DOCUMENT 0
    Title: Example Title
    Data: Example Data...
RECENT MESSAGES:
  - Message 1: Hello, how can I help you?
  - Message 2: Can you provide more information about the company?
INSTRUCTIONS:
  Answer the user QUESTION using the DOCUMENTS text above...
QUESTION: What services does Hexastack offer?
```

The plugin will then use this prompt to generate a response via the Google Generative AI API.
