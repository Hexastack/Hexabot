 * The `id` field represents the unique identifier of the uploaded attachment in the system.
 * 2. By `url`: This is used when the attachment is externally hosted, especially when
 * the content is generated or retrieved by a plugin that consumes a third-party API.
 * In this case, the `url` field contains the direct link to the external resource.
