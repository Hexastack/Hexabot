Hexabot's chatbot builder allows you to create multilingual chatbots by managing languages within the platform. This feature enables you to define the languages your chatbot will support and handle translations for blocks, messages, quick replies, buttons, and more.

### Key Features

* **Add, update, and delete languages**: You can easily manage the languages your chatbot supports.
* **Multilingual conversations**: The chatbot will automatically use the language of the end-user (subscriber).
* **Translation capabilities**: Each language defined in the system allows you to translate blocks, messages, quick replies, buttons, etc.
* **Default language**: You can set a default language for your chatbot. This will be the fallback language if no specific language is detected or set for the end-user.
* **RTL support**: For languages that are written from right to left (RTL), such as Arabic or Hebrew, you can specify whether a language is RTL or not.
