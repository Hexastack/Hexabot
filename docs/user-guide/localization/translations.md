**Tips**

* **Review and Test:** Carefully review your translations and test your chatbot in each target language to ensure the language switching works as expected and that the translations flow naturally within the conversation.
* **Regular Updates:** If your chatbot's content changes frequently, keep your translations updated as well to provide a consistent experience for your multilingual users.
