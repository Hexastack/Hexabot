# Categories

Hexabot's Categories feature allows you to organize your chatbot's conversation flows into different sections, creating dedicated tabs within the Visual Editor. This makes it easier to manage complex chatbots with multiple topics or functionalities.

**1. Access Category Management:**

* Find the "Categories" section within dashboard.

**2. Viewing Your Categories:**

The Category List displays a table of the categories you have created. Each category is identified by its label. The table also shows information about when each category was created and last updated.

**3. Creating New Categories:**

* **Add a Category:** Click on the "Add" button to create a new category. This will open a dialog where you can:
  * **Enter a Label:** Type in a unique and descriptive label for the category (e.g., "Product Support," "Order Processing," "Customer Onboarding").
  * **Submit:** Click "SUBMIT" to save the new category.

**4. Managing Existing Categories:**

* **Edit Category:** Click on the edit icon (pencil) next to a category to modify its label.
* **Delete Category:** Click on the delete icon (trash can) next to a category to delete it.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Hexabot will prevent you from deleting a category if there are still blocks associated with it within the Visual Editor. You will need to either move those blocks to a different category or delete them before you can delete the category itself.
{% endhint %}

**Using Categories in the Visual Editor:**

When you open the Visual Editor, you'll see a tab for each category you've created. Select the category tab where you want to design your conversation flow. You can easily switch between the category tabs to organize your conversation flows.
