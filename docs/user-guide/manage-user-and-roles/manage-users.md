# Manage users

Hexabot's user management system allows you to control access to your chatbot project, ensuring that the right people have the right permissions. This guide walks you through the steps of adding, editing, and managing users in your Hexabot workspace.

* Locate the "Users" or "User Management" section. This is typically found in the main menu under Admin section.

**2. Adding New Users:**

* **Click the "+ INVITE".**  This will usually open a form or dialog box where you can create a new user account.
* **Provide User Details:** Fill in the required fields, which typically include:
  * **Email Address:** The user's primary email address.
* **Assign Initial Role :** Assign a role during user creation, choose the most appropriate role based on the user's responsibilities. By default, Hexabot present you with 3 key roles that you can choose from : manager, public and admin.
* **Send Invitation :** If your Hexabot is configured to send emails, you can send the new user an invitation email to activate their account. If you're unable to send the invitation, please contact your system administrator to verify the email settings.

**3. Editing User Information:**
