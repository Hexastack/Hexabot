# Subscribers

In Hexabot, we define a subscriber as then end-user who will ultimately interact with the chatbot. The Subscriber Management features allow you to effectively track, organize, and interact with the users who engage with your chatbot. This guide will walk you through the process of managing your subscriber base, segmenting them using labels, and leveraging subscriber data for improved communication and targeted interactions.

**1. Access Subscriber Management:**

* Open the "Manage Subscribers" page from sidebar menu.

**2. Viewing Your Subscriber List:**

* **Subscriber List:** The subscriber list displays information about each user who has interacted with your chatbot. This includes:
  * **First Name and Last Name:** The name assigned to each user.
  * **Channel:** The platform where the user interacted with your chatbot (e.g., "Facebook Messenger," "Website," "Live Chat Tester", ...).
  * **Gender:** The user's gender, if provided.
  * **Locale:** The user's language preference or location (e.g., "en-US" for English, United States).
  * **Labels:** Any labels that have been assigned to the subscriber.
  * **Created Date:** The date when the user first interacted with your chatbot.
  * **Updated At:** The date when the user's profile was last updated.

**3. Managing Individual Subscribers:**

Click on the "MANAGE LABELS" button next to the subscriber to manage their labels. You'll be presented with a dialog where you can:

* **Select a Label:** Choose the label(s) you want to assign to the subscriber.
* **Submit:** Click on the "SUBMIT" button to confirm the label assignment.

**4. Using Subscriber Labels:**

* **Label Management:** Hexabot's label management system allows you to categorize and segment your subscribers based on their interests, behaviors, or other characteristics.
* **Create Labels:**
  * Click on the "Add" button in the "Labels" section to create a new label. You'll be presented with a dialog where you can:
    * **Title (Required):** Enter a descriptive title for the label (e.g., "Interested in Products," "Needs Customer Support," "Active Users").
    * **Name:** a unique name for the label generated based on the provided title (e.g., "product\_interest", "need\_support", "active\_users").
    * **Description (Optional):** Provide a more detailed description of the label (e.g., "Users who have expressed interest in specific products," "Users who have requested customer support," "Users who have interacted with the chatbot in the last 30 days").
    * **Submit:** Click on the "SUBMIT" button to save the new label.

**Using Labels for Targeted Communication:**

* **Conversation Flows:** Create different conversation flows for subscribers who belong to specific labels.
* **Promotional Messages:** Send targeted promotional messages based on subscriber labels.
* **Personalized Responses:** Use labels to provide more personalized responses to users based on their interests or behaviors.

**Best Practices for Subscriber Management:**

* **Clear Label Strategy:** Develop a well-defined strategy for using labels to ensure that your segmentation is meaningful and effective.
* **Regular Updates:** Keep your subscriber data up to date, and regularly review your label assignments to ensure they remain accurate.
