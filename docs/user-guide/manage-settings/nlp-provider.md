# NLP Provider

Hexabot comes equipped with a built-in NLP (Natural Language Processing) engine, which helps your chatbot understand the intent behind user messages. You can configure the NLP settings to tailor its behavior. This guide walks you through managing the NLP Provider settings in Hexabot.

**1. Access NLP Provider Settings:**

* Log in to your Hexabot account.
* Go to the "Settings" page.
* Select the "NLP Provider" section.

**2. Configure Default Language:**

* **Choose Default Language:** Select the primary language that your chatbot should use for understanding user input. This setting defines the default language that the NLP engine will use for interpretation.

**3. Adjust the Fallback Threshold:**

* **Fallback Confidence Threshold:** This setting controls how confident the NLP engine needs to be about its predictions before taking action.
  * **Threshold Value:** The threshold is a value between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
  * **Interpretation:** A higher threshold requires a greater degree of certainty from the NLP engine, potentially leading to more accurate but more conservative responses. A lower threshold allows for more flexibility, but may increase the likelihood of errors or inaccurate interpretations.
