# Manage Persistent Menu

The Persistent Menu allows you to provide users with a consistent and accessible menu of options directly within their chat interface. It's like a built-in navigation system for your chatbot, ensuring that users always have quick access to key features and information, regardless of where they are in the conversation flow.

## **Step-by-Step Guide to Creating and Managing Persistent Menus:**

1. **Access the Persistent Menu Settings:**
   * Log in to your Hexabot account.
   * Find the "Persistent Menu" section. This is located in under the Manage Content Menu.
2. **Design Your Menu Structure:**
   * **Main Menu Items:** Decide on the key options you want to present to users (e.g., "Get Started," "Products," "Support," "About Us").
   * **Submenus (Optional):** Consider adding submenus under your main menu items for a more hierarchical navigation.
3. **Add Menu Items:**
   * Use the Hexabot interface to add each menu item. You'll typically be able to:
     * **Enter the Title:** The text displayed for the menu item (e.g., "View Products").
     * **Choose the Action Type:**
       * **Postback:** Sends a payload back to the chatbot, allowing you to trigger a specific conversation flow or action.
       * **Web URL:** Opens an external website in a new browser tab.
       * **Nested**
     * **Set the Payload or URL (Based on Action Type):**
       * **For Postbacks:** Enter a unique payload for each menu item, which you can use to trigger specific responses or actions in your chatbot's conversation flows.
       * **For Web URLs:** Enter the complete web address.
4. **Save and Publish Your Menu:**
   * Click the "Submit" button to make your Persistent Menu active for users interacting with your chatbot.
