# Knowledge Base

Hexabot's built-in Knowledge Base is where you store and manage all the information your chatbot uses to interact with users. Think of it as  a centralized knowledge base that keeps all your chatbot's responses accurate, consistent, and up-to-date.

**Managing Content in the Knowledge Base:**

1. **Create Content Types:** Organize your information by creating content types relevant to your chatbot (e.g., "Products," "Services," "FAQs").
2. **Define Fields (Metadata):** For each content type, define the data fields you need. For a "Product" type, you might have "Name," "Description," "Price," "Image URL," etc.
3. **Populate Content Entries:** Create individual entries within each content type, filling in the data fields. You might have a separate entry for each product in your catalog, each service you offer, or each question in your FAQ section.
