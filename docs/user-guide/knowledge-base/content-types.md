# Content Types

The Knowledge Base allows you to organize your chatbot's content into different types, making it easy to structure and manage the information your chatbot uses to interact with users. This guide walks you through creating, customizing, and managing your content types effectively:

**1. Access the Knowledge Base:** Go to the "Knowledge Base" section, usually found in the main menu or chatbot settings.

**2. Create a New Content Type:**

* **Click "Add Content Type" (or a similar button/option).** This will typically open a form or dialog box where you can define the details of your new content type.
* **Enter a Name:** Provide a descriptive name for your content type that accurately represents the kind of information it will hold. For example, "Products," "Services," "Blog Posts," "FAQs," etc.
* **Save the Content Type:** Click the "Submit" button to save the new content type.

**Important** Each new content type you create in the Knowledge Base comes with two default fields: "Title" and "Status." These fields provide basic information for your content entries.

**3. Add Fields to a Content Type:**

* **Locate the Content Type:** Find the content type you just created in the list of available content types within the Knowledge Base.
* **Access Field Management:** Look for the "Manage Content" option
* **Add New Field:** In addition to the default "Title" and "Status" fields, click +ADD button to create a new field and configure the following: Click a button to create a new field and configure the following:
  * **Field Label:** This is the display name for the field, the name that will be visible to users. Choose a clear and descriptive label, e.g., "Product Name," "Description," "Price."
  * **Field Name:** This is a unique identifier for the field. It is **auto-generated** from the Field Label and does not need to be manually entered.
  * **Field Type:** Select the appropriate data type for the field from the following options:
    * **Text :** For short text.
    * **Text Input:** For short single-line text input.
    * **URL:** For website address inputs.
    * **Text Area:** For longer, multi-line text input.
    * **Checkbox:** For true/false or yes/no selections.
    * **File:** For uploading files (documents, images, etc.).
    * **HTML:** For adding content with HTML formatting.
  * **Save Field Changes:** After configuring the field, click the "Submit" button to confirm your changes.

**4. Manage Existing Fields:**

* **Edit a Field:** Locate the field within the content type and look for options to "Edit," "Modify," or "Rename" the field.
* **Delete a Field:** If a field is no longer needed, you can usually find an option to "Delete" or "Remove" it. Be careful, as deleting a field will also remove all data associated with that field in your content entries.

**Tips**

* **Plan Your Content Structure:** Think carefully about the types of information your chatbot needs and design your content types accordingly.
* **Keep it Simple:** Start with the essential fields and add more as needed. It's easier to add fields later than to remove them if they prove to be unnecessary.
* **Use Descriptive Names:** Make field names easy to understand for you and anyone else who might be working with your chatbot's content.
