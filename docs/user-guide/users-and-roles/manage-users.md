# Manage users

Hexabot's user management system allows you to control access to your chatbot project, ensuring that the right people have the right permissions. This guide walks you through the steps of adding, editing, and managing users in your Hexabot workspace.

### **1. Access User Management:**

* Log in to your Hexabot account.
* Locate the "Users" or "User Management" section. This is typically found in the main menu under Admin section.

### **2. Adding New Users:**

* **Click the "+ INVITE"** butto&#x6E;**.**  This opens a form where you can create a new user account.
* **Provide User Details:** Fill in the required fields, which typically include:
  * **Email Address:** The user's primary email address.
  * **Role :** Assign a role during user creation, choose the most appropriate role based on the user's responsibilities. By default, Hexabot present you with 3 key roles that you can choose from : manager, public and admin.
* **Send Invitation :** Click on "SEND" button to invite the new user to join. If your Hexabot is configured properly to send emails, he will receive an email with a link to register and activate their account. If you're unable to send the invitation, please contact your system administrator to verify the email settings.

### **3. Editing Role:**

* **View User List:** Find the user you want to edit in the list of users within the User Management section.
* **Click on "Manage Roles" :** This will open a dialog window, where you can make adjustments to the user roles. Change the user's role to grant them different permissions.

### 4. Managing User Account Status

In Hexabot's User Management section, you can control the status of each user account. This allows you to activate or deactivate a given user's access to the platform. While you cannot permanently delete user accounts, you can effectively disable them to prevent them from accessing the system.

* **Enabled:** A user with an "**Enabled**" status has full access to Hexabot, based on their assigned role and permissions.
* **Disabled:** A user with a "**Disabled**" status cannot access Hexabot. They will not be able to log in or perform any actions.

**Managing Account Status:**

* **Locate the User:** Find the user whose account status you want to modify in the list of users within the User Management section.
* **Change Status:** Look for an option to "**Enable**" or "**Disable**" the user's account.
  * **Disabling an Account:** To prevent a user from accessing Hexabot, set their account status to "**Disabled**."
  * **Reactivating an Account:** To restore access to a user, set their account status to "**Enabled**."

**Important Note:** Disabling an account does not permanently delete the account data. The user profile and all associated information are still stored in the Hexabot system. If you need to remove a user's data completely, you'll need to contact your Hexabot administrator or our support team for assistance.
