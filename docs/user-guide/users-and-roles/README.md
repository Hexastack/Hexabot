# Users and Roles

Hexabot offers robust user and role management features to streamline collaboration and ensure security within your chatbot projects. Whether you're working with a team of developers, content creators, or marketing professionals, Hexabot makes it easy to grant the right access levels to the right people.

**Why Manage Users and Roles?**

* **Security:** Control who has access to your chatbot project and which parts of the platform they can access.
* **Collaboration:** Enable multiple individuals to work together on your chatbot project efficiently without disrupting each other's work.
* **Clear Responsibilities:** Assign specific roles to team members based on their expertise and responsibilities, ensuring that everyone is focused on the right tasks.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Users:** Individuals with accounts in Hexabot. Each user has a unique profile and set of permissions.
* **Roles:** Predefined sets of permissions that determine what actions a user can take within the platform.

**Example Scenarios:**

* **Developer:** A developer might have full access to all areas of the platform, including the Visual Editor, NLP training, and the CMS.
* **Content Creator:** A content creator may have access to the CMS to update chatbot responses and manage knowledge base entries, but might not have access to code or NLP training settings.
