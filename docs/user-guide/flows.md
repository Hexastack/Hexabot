# Flows

Hexabot's Flows feature allows you to organize your chatbot's conversation flows into different sections, creating dedicated tabs within the Visual Editor. This makes it easier to manage complex chatbots with multiple topics or functionalities.

**1. Access Flow Management:**

* Find the "Flows" section within dashboard.

**2. Viewing Your Flows:**

The Flow List displays a table of the flows you have created. Each flow is identified by its label. The table also shows information about when each flow was created and last updated.

**3. Creating a New Flow:**

* **Add a Flow:** Click on the "Add" button to create a new flow. This will open a dialog where you can:
  * **Enter a Label:** Type in a unique and descriptive label for the flow (e.g., "Product Support," "Order Processing," "Customer Onboarding").
  * **Submit:** Click "SUBMIT" to save the new flow.

**4. Managing Existing Flows:**

* **Edit a Flow:** Click on the edit icon (pencil) next to a flow to modify its label.
* **Delete a Flow:** Click on the delete icon (trash can) next to a flow to delete it.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Hexabot will prevent you from deleting a flow if there are still blocks associated with it within the Visual Editor. You will need to either move those blocks to a different flow or delete them before you can delete the flow itself.
{% endhint %}

**Using Flows in the Visual Editor:**

When you open the Visual Editor, you'll see a tab for each flow you've created. Select the flow tab where you want to design your conversation flow. You can easily switch between the flow tabs to organize your conversation flows.
