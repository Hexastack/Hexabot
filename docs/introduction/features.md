## **AI-Powered Interactions**

### **Natural Language Understanding Engine**

Hexabot leverages cutting-edge NLP technology, to understand user intent, extract key information from messages, and tailor personalized responses. This allows for more natural and engaging conversations.

{% hint style="info" %}
**What is NLP ?** In simple terms, NLP is a branch of AI that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful. You can read more about NLP in the [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") section.
{% endhint %}

* **Intent Recognition:** Hexabot's NLP engine analyzes user messages to identify the underlying intent. This understanding drives the chatbot's ability to provide relevant responses and trigger specific actions.
* **Entity Extraction:** Identify and extract key information from user input, such as dates, locations, names, or product preferences. This data can be used to personalize the conversation and improve the accuracy of the chatbot's responses.

### Generative AI Capabilities

By default, Hexabot comes with a default installed plugin that is called **"LLM RAG"** that integrates with _OpenAI ChatGPT_. You can choose of course to build your own plugin that integrates with a custom fine-tuned LLM or any other LLM. This plugin leverages cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI techniques to enhance your chatbot's contextual understanding and responsiveness. Provide your chatbot with relevant context, and the **"LLM RAG"** plugin will generate more informative, and human-like responses, resulting in more engaging and satisfying conversations for your audience.

## **Content Management System (CMS)**&#x20;

Hexabot features a built-in Content Management System (CMS) that serves as a centralized knowledge base for your chatbot. This empowers you to easily update and expand your chatbot's knowledge without requiring changes to the conversation flow itself.

The Hexabot CMS provides a central location within the admin panel to manage all the content that your chatbot uses to interact with users. Organize content by type, define custom fields to structure information, and easily edit or update content as needed.

Create and manage translations for all of your chatbot's content directly within the CMS. This enables you to build chatbots that cater to a diverse, multilingual audience, delivering a more personalized and engaging experience for users around the globe.
