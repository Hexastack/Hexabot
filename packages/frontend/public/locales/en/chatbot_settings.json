    "default_nlu_penalty_factor": "The NLU penalty factor is a coefficient (between 0 and 1) applied exclusively to NLU-based entity matching. It reduces the score contribution of patterns that match broadly (e.g. using wildcard values like Any) rather than specific entity values. This helps the engine prioritize blocks triggered by more precise NLU matches, without affecting other matching strategies such as text, regex, or interaction triggers.",
    "default_flow_escape_helper": "The Flow Escape helper is used when the userâ€™s message does not match any option in a flow. It assists the chatbot in deciding whether to re-prompt, provide an explanation, or end the conversation."
