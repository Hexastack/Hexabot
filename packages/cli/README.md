# Hexabot CLI

Hexabot CLI is the command-line entry point for creating, configuring, and operating Hexabot v3 projects. With it, you can scaffold new automation workspaces, initialize environments, start services in local or Docker modes, run database migrations, and manage the project lifecycle.


Not yet familiar with [Hexabot](https://hexabot.ai/)? Hexabot v3 is an agentic AI automation platform for building and running workflows across channels with actions, bindings, memory, tools, MCP, and RAG. If you would like to learn more, please visit the [official GitHub repo](https://github.com/hexabot-ai/Hexabot/).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20.19.0
- One package manager (`npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, or `bun`)
- Docker Desktop/Engine (only required when you pass `--docker` or use `hexabot docker ...`)

### Installation

Install Hexabot CLI globally to have easy access to its commands:

```sh
npm install -g @hexabot-ai/cli
```

### Usage

Once installed, you can use the `hexabot` command anywhere. The CLI focuses on a “zero to running workflow automation” path: create a project, `cd` into it, and run `hexabot dev`. Docker is optional and available via `--docker` or the `hexabot docker ...` helpers.

### Commands

#### `create <project-name>`

Scaffold a new Hexabot automation project from the official NestJS starter template.

```sh
hexabot create support-automation
```

Common options:

- `-t, --template <name>` – template repository. Use `org/repo` or shorthand `starter`.
- `--pm <npm|pnpm|yarn|bun>` – force a package manager (auto-detected otherwise).
- `--no-install` – skip running the package manager after scaffolding.
- `--dev` – immediately run `hexabot dev` once creation is complete.
- `--docker` – show Docker-first next steps and use Docker mode when combined with `--dev`.
- `--force` – allow scaffolding into a non-empty directory.

The command downloads the latest template release, installs dependencies (unless `--no-install`), and bootstraps `.env` plus `.env.docker` when their example files are present. The Docker env file is initialized with `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=<project-name>` so Docker Compose uses the scaffolded project name.

#### `dev`

Run the current project in development mode. Defaults to local (SQLite) development by running the configured package script (defaults to `npm run dev`).

```sh
# Local dev
hexabot dev

# Docker dev with Postgres profile
hexabot dev --docker --services postgres
```

Options:

- `--docker` – run Docker Compose instead of the package script.
- `--services <list>` – comma-separated Compose overlays/profiles to enable.
- `-d, --detach` – detach Docker Compose.
- `--env <file>` – custom env file for local dev (defaults to `.env`).
- `--no-env-bootstrap` – skip copying `.env.example` files automatically.
- `--pm <npm|pnpm|yarn|bun>` – temporarily override the package manager.

#### `env`

Helper commands to manage `.env` files.

- `hexabot env init` – copy `.env.example` ➜ `.env`.
- `hexabot env init --docker` – copy `.env.docker.example` ➜ `.env.docker`.
- `hexabot env list` – show which env files exist or are missing.

Flags: `--force` overwrites existing files when running `env init`.

#### `docker`

Quality-of-life wrappers around `docker compose` using the project’s `docker/` folder.

- `hexabot docker up [--services <list>] [--build] [-d]`
- `hexabot docker down [--services <list>] [--volumes]`
- `hexabot docker logs [service] [-f | --since <1h>]`
- `hexabot docker ps`
- `hexabot docker start [--services <list>] [--build] [-d]` – convenience alias for `hexabot start --docker`

The CLI automatically stitches together `docker-compose.yml` + `docker-compose.<service>.yml` overlays and can copy `.env.docker.example` on first run.

#### `start`

Production-oriented variant of `dev`.

```sh
hexabot start
hexabot start --docker --services api,postgres --build
```

- Local mode runs the configured `start` script (defaults to `npm run start`).
- Docker mode uses the “prod” compose overlays (e.g. `docker-compose.<service>.prod.yml`) so no dev-specific files are chained.
- Pass `--env-bootstrap` if you still want the CLI to copy env examples automatically.

#### `check`

Run diagnostics for the current environment.

```sh
hexabot check
hexabot check --docker-only
```

Outputs PASS/FAIL entries for Node.js version, project detection, env files, and optionally Docker.

#### `config`

Inspect or tweak `hexabot.config.json` without editing it manually.

- `hexabot config show`
- `hexabot config set <key> <value>` (supports dot notation, e.g. `docker.defaultServices "postgres,redis"`)

#### `migrate [args...]`

Run database migrations inside the Docker `api` container. Any extra args are forwarded to `npm run migrate`.

## Example Workflow

1. **Create a new project** (installs dependencies automatically unless `--no-install`):

   ```sh
   npx @hexabot-ai/cli create support-automation
   ```

2. **Enter the project and start local dev (SQLite, no Docker required)**:

   ```sh
   cd support-automation
   hexabot dev
   ```

3. **Need infrastructure like Postgres or Redis? Opt in with Docker**:

   ```sh
   hexabot dev --docker --services postgres,redis
   # or manage Docker services directly
   hexabot docker up --services postgres
   ```

That’s it—`create → cd → dev` is the happy path for a new Hexabot v3 automation project, while Docker and env helpers remain available on demand.
